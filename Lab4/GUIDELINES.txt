THIS LAB EXERCISE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF THE TA'S IN EC327 (A SASSY FRIEND BY THE NAME OF STEVEN MALONEY)

In this problem we will help you and your friends split the bill. You will make a program for a waiter to help collect the bill. The function tip should take the total including tax, and return the total with tax. 
Tax should take an item cost and ask what type of item it is. If it is (l)iquor then it should be taxed at 12%, if it is (f)ood then it should be taxed at 9%. 
Finally, you should put in the final bill (including tip and tax) and how many people you are splitting it with and the function should return how much each person owes.
If the user puts in a tip below 15 then ask them again for a higher tip. If the user puts in a tip above 20 then tell them they are very generous.

Function prototypes:
double tip(double total, double percent); 
double tax(double amount, char kind); 
double split(double total, int people);

Example output
bash$ ./Lab4P3
What is the amount? $12.29
Is it (f) or (l)iuqor? l
Do you have more items? (y/n) y
What is the amount? $14.32
Is it (f) or (l)iuqor? f
Do you have more items? (y/n) y
What is the amount? $9.99
Is it (f) or (l)iuqor? l
Do you have more items? (y/n) n
What would percent would you like to tip? 12 Tip should be greater or equal to 15.
Percent? 15
How many people are you splitting this with? 2 Your total will be $12.8671 per person. Program ends
